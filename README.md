# clothes-reviews-sentiment-analysis-
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for sentiment analysis of clothes reviews. The project uses Python and several natural language processing (NLP) libraries, including NLTK, TextBlob...

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a collection of clothes reviews from an online fashion retailer. The dataset can be downloaded from the following Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews or from Data provided.

## Getting Started
To use this notebook, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

You will also need to install the following libraries using pip:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
nltk
textblob
Once you have installed these dependencies, you can open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to follow along with the sentiment analysis.

## Methodology
The sentiment analysis in this project is performed using a combination of natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. The notebook walks through the following steps:

Loading and cleaning the dataset
Exploratory data analysis
Preprocessing the text data using NLTK, TextBlob...
Feature extraction using bag-of-words and TF-IDF vectorization
Training and testing machine learning models using Logistic Regression and XGBoost
Evaluating the performance of the models
Visualizing the results using a confusion matrix

## Conclusion
This project provides a practical introduction to sentiment analysis of text data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. By analyzing the clothes reviews dataset and completing the notebook, you will gain a deeper understanding of the NLP techniques involved in sentiment analysis, such as text preprocessing, feature extraction, and sentiment classification. Additionally, you will gain practical experience in implementing and comparing the performance of two popular machine learning models, logistic regression and XGBoost, for sentiment analysis tasks. This project can serve as a foundation for further exploration and application of NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms to other real-world sentiment analysis problems.
